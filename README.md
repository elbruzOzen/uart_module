10 MBit UART Module written in VHDL

- Please add 2 FIFO by using Xilinx's FIFO Generator IP inside UART module.<br>
- Default and max clock frequency is 100 MHz.<br>
- Also for implementation you may need to determine constraints (Timing,Pins)<br>
- Baud rate can be given as generic.<br>
- Designed using Xilinx ISE Webpack.<br>
